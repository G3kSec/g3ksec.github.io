# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm G3kSec.

### I'm a Full Stack Developer in transition to the exciting world of cybersecurity.

### As a Full Stack Developer, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and gain experience developing web and desktop applications. From the frontend to the backend.

### However, interest and curiosity in cybersecurity has been growing in recent times.

### In my search for knowledge in cybersecurity, I have turned to various sources of learning. On platforms like Hack The Box (HTB) or TryHackMe, where I get the chance to take on ethical hacking challenges and improve my technical skills in a hands-on and secure environment. In addition, I have also taken advantage of cybersecurity courses to deepen key concepts and techniques.

### I cannot fail to mention the many resources available on YouTube and the extensive online documentation that I am using to broaden my understanding and stay up to date with the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity.

### Through my blog, I hope to share my experience, knowledge and perspectives on Full Stack development and everything I learn about cybersecurity. From practical tips and tricks to in-depth analysis of security techniques and tools, I'll be happy to provide valuable and relevant content for those who are also interested in this exciting field.

### *Thanks for reading this and I'm excited to share more with you through my blog.*
