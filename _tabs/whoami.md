## Â¡Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm G3kSec

I'm a Full Stack Developer transitioning into the exciting world of cybersecurity. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and gain experience in developing web and desktop applications, covering both the front-end and back-end.

However, my interest and curiosity in cybersecurity have been growing lately.

In my quest for knowledge in cybersecurity, I've turned to various learning sources. Platforms like Hack The Box (HTB) or TryHackMe provide me with the opportunity to take on ethical hacking challenges and enhance my technical skills in a practical and secure environment. Additionally, I've taken advantage of specialized cybersecurity courses to delve deeper into key concepts and techniques.

I can't fail to mention the wealth of resources available on YouTube and the extensive online documentation that I use to broaden my understanding and stay up to date with the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity.

Through my blog, I aim to share my experience, knowledge, and perspectives on Full Stack development, as well as everything I learn about cybersecurity. From practical tips and tricks to in-depth analysis of security techniques and tools, I'll be delighted to provide valuable and relevant content for those who are also interested in this exciting field.

*Thanks for reading this and I'm excited to share more with you through my blog.*
