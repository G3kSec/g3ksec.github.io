## ¿What is an IP Address?

**An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numeric identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.** These addresses are essential to the functioning of the Internet and networks, as that allow identification and communication between devices.

*They are like telephone numbers. When you communicate with someone, their phone number identifies who you are and reassures the person who answers that they are who they say they are. IP addresses do exactly the same thing when they are online.*

## Importance

- **Unique identification**: IP addresses allow the unique identification of each device connected to a network. This is essential for devices to communicate with each other correctly and for data routing on the network.

- **Internet Communication**: IP addresses allow devices to send and receive data over the Internet. This enables the transmission of information, web browsing, sending emails, video calls, among others.

- **Data Routing**: IP addresses are essential for data routing. Routers and servers use these addresses to direct data packets to the correct destination on the network.

**¡There is no device in the world that can communicate with another without having an IP!**

## Types of IP addresses

There are two types of IP addresses:

- **Public IP Address**: A public IP address is assigned to a device directly connected to the Internet. This address is globally unique and allows the device to be identified and to communicate with other devices on the Internet. Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are used to access online services such as websites, email servers, cloud services, and more. Any device that connects to the Internet needs to have a public IP address in order to communicate globally.

- **Private IP Address**: A private IP address is used within a private network, such as a local home network or a business network. These addresses are used to securely connect and communicate devices within a private network. Private IP addresses are not globally unique and can be reused across different private networks. These addresses are assigned by the network administrator and are not directly accessible from the Internet. Some examples of private IP address ranges are:
  - Class A: `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
  - Class B: `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
  - Class C: `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`

*Private IP addresses allow the creation of local networks and make it easy to connect devices in a controlled and protected environment.*

*It is important to note that devices on a private network can share a single public IP address when routing and Network Address Translation (NAT) techniques are used to access the Internet. This helps preserve public IP addresses, as they are reused within the private network.*

## Versions

Hay dos versiones principales de direcciones IP en uso actualmente:

**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: It is the most common IP addressing system. It is made up of a series of four sets of numbers separated by periods, such as `192.168.0.1`. However, due to the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, the transition to IPv6 has become increasingly important.

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: It is a more recent version and offers a much larger address space. IPv6 addresses are made up of eight sets of numbers and letters separated by colons, such as `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

## Safety and Prevention

- **Security**: IP addresses can be used to carry out malicious activities, such as computer attacks or intrusion attempts. Therefore, it is important to have adequate security measures in place, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to protect devices and networks from potential threats.

- **Privacy**: IP addresses can be used to track the online activity of a device. In some cases, techniques such as IP address masking using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) may be used to preserve user privacy.

## Uses of IP addresses

- **Internet Connection**: Every time you connect to the Internet from your device, it is assigned an IP address so that you can communicate with other devices and access online services.

- **Server Hosting**: Servers on the Internet also have IP addresses assigned so that other devices can access the services they offer, such as websites, email servers, file servers, etc.

- **Network applications**: IP addresses are used in various network applications, such as online games, messaging applications, content streaming services, among others.
